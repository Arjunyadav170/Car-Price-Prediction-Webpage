## Project overview
1.This project predicts the price of second-hand cars using machine learning algorithms, specifically the Decision Tree algorithm.
2.The model analyzes available data to estimate the price based on various features.
3.It is a web-based application where users can enter or select their preferred car details, and the model predicts the estimated price accordingly.
4.This project provides a user-friendly and interactive experience, making it easy and engaging for users to estimate car prices. 

## Dataset Use
. In this Projct we use Kaggle dataset 
-<a href ="[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge]" >Kaggle Dataset link </a>
.This dataset have many feature so that overall best for predict car price as user requirement 
. Dataset feature ->Price	,Levy,	Manufacturer,	Model,	Prod. year,	Category,	Leather, interior,	Fuel type,	Engine volume,	Mileage,	Cylinders,	Gear box type,	Drive wheels,	Doors,	Wheel,	Color.
