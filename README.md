## Project overview
1.This project predicts the price of second-hand cars using machine learning algorithms, specifically the Decision Tree algorithm.<br>
2.The model analyzes available data to estimate the price based on various features.<br>  
3.It is a web-based application where users can enter or select their preferred car details, and the model predicts the estimated price accordingly. <br>
4.This project provides a user-friendly and interactive experience, making it easy and engaging for users to estimate car prices. 

## Dataset Use
. In this Projct we use Kaggle dataset <br>
-<a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge" >Kaggle Dataset link </a><br>

.This dataset have many feature so that overall best for predict car price as user requirement<br> 
. Dataset feature ->Price	,Levy,	Manufacturer,	Model,	Prod. year,	Category,	Leather, interior,	Fuel type,	Engine volume,	Mileage,	Cylinders,	Gear box type,
Drive wheels,	Doors,	Wheel,	Color.

## How to Run the Project on Your PC
1.Download the important files to your PC, such as Model_train.py, My_app.py, home.html, and style.css.<br>
2.Install the required Python libraries mentioned in train_model.py for training the model.<br>
3.Run the application, fill in all the details of your favorite car, and click the Prediction button to get the estimated price of the second-hand car.<br>

## Real-Life Use Cases of This Project
1.Helps Buyers Make Informed Decisions üß†
2.Enhances Negotiation Power  Predicted Prices as a Benchmark ‚úç
3.Saves Time and Effort Because Buyers Already Sure about Car and there Price üí∞
4. Prevents Fraud and Overpricing
